> *Agents for Role Play. Agents for Game. Agents as a Game.*
> A file-backed, event-sourced engine for living worlds.

WorldLines is an Agentic AIRP engine (AI RolePlay engine) co-developed
by **nikoloside** and **redoctober**, continuously advanced together
with [Ludic Dynamics](https://ludicdynamics.com). The engine binary is
codenamed `neonrp`; the release brand is **WorldLines**.

It treats the game world as a versioned, file-backed state machine, so
your playthroughs, your edits, and your Agents become reproducible
artifacts — not ephemeral chat logs.

## Why WorldLines

Traditional "chat with an AI" interfaces lose everything the moment the
context window fills. WorldLines gives you the guarantees of a real engine:

- **⭐ File-persisted memory & world state.** Everything — memory, saves,
  NPCs, Agents — lives on disk as plain JSON and Markdown. No cloud,
  no database, no hidden state. If you can open the folder, you own
  the world.
- **Auto-indexed context, auto-injected.** WorldLines builds a file
  index and a local vector database automatically, and injects only
  the relevant game data into each Agent's context per turn. No manual
  lorebook juggling.
- **Event-sourced state.** Every turn is an append-only Event; Snapshots
  make rewind fast.
- **Branch / Undo / Redo.** Explore narrative forks like git branches.
- **Sandbox & Replay.** Run experiments in isolation; verify determinism.
- **Orchestrator-driven multi-agent.** An Orchestrator routes to domain
  Agents (town / dungeon / combat-referee / world-builder / rules-referee)
  over one shared state.
- **Plan → Diff → Apply.** LLMs emit structured file operations you can
  review before they land.
- **Rich TUI.** A Claude-Code-style conversational terminal for both
  play and build.
- **Local-first models.** GLM, OpenAI, LM Studio, or Ollama.

### How WorldLines compares

|                         | Character.AI        | SillyTavern              | Claude Code             | **WorldLines**                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Primary domain          | Character chat      | Prompt frontend           | Code editing            | Living game worlds                  |
| Your world lives in     | Their service       | Prompt config + chat logs | Codebase on disk        | **Plain files + git**               |
| Memory & retrieval      | Cloud / opaque      | Manual lorebook           | Codebase retrieval      | **Auto file index + vector DB**     |
| Multi-agent             | —                   | —                         | Subagents per task      | Orchestrator + domain agents        |
| Local-first LLM         | No                  | Bring your own            | API-only                | GLM / LM Studio / Ollama            |
| Determinism / replay    | —                   | —                         | —                       | **Sandbox + Replay**                |

If Claude Code is your IDE for code, WorldLines is your IDE for living
worlds — with the memory, retrieval, and orchestration baked in.

> Note: WorldLines's harness is currently stricter than Claude Code's — it depends on complete context to orchestrate reliably. This is a deliberate tradeoff for higher determinism and easier debugging, not a deficiency.

## Install

### One-liner

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://worldlines.gg/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://worldlines.gg/install.ps1 | iex
```

Installs `uv` (if missing) then `uv tool install worldlines`. Verify
with `neonrp --help` or just `worldlines`.

### Double-click launcher

Prefer not to touch a terminal? Download a platform launcher and
double-click it. Each opens a terminal window, runs the first-time
install (or self-updates on subsequent launches), then hands off to the
TUI:

| Platform | File                 | Download |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| macOS    | `WorldLines.command` | [latest](https://worldlines.gg/WorldLines.command) |
| Windows  | `WorldLines.bat`     | [latest](https://worldlines.gg/WorldLines.bat)     |
| Linux    | `WorldLines.sh`      | [latest](https://worldlines.gg/WorldLines.sh)      |

After download (macOS / Linux), `chmod +x` once:

```bash
chmod +x ~/Downloads/WorldLines.command   # or WorldLines.sh
```

Then drag to Desktop / Dock and treat it like any other shortcut.

### Users in China

Some mainland networks throttle GitHub Releases and Cloudflare-fronted
domains. If `curl https://worldlines.gg/install.sh` times out:

```bash
# Direct GitHub fetch (sometimes faster than the Cloudflare redirect):
curl -LsSf \
  https://github.com/LudicDynamics/WorldLines/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  | sh

# Or force uv to use a Tsinghua PyPI mirror:
export UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
uv tool install worldlines

# Or both at once:
CHINA_MIRROR=1 curl -LsSf https://worldlines.gg/install.sh | sh
```

Auto-update (`neonrp self-update`) honors `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX`, so
exporting it in your shell profile keeps future upgrades on the mirror.

### Developers — editable install

```bash
uv tool install -e /path/to/worldlines
neonrp --help
```

[docs.worldlines.gg/docs/guides/launcher](https://docs.worldlines.gg/docs/guides/launcher).

## Quickstart

```bash
# Fresh directory — /init is enough to start in build mode
mkdir my-world && cd my-world
neonrp init

# Or scaffold the stoneford starter for a headline sample
neonrp game new --template stoneford

# Launch the TUI
neonrp tui
```

Fresh projects expose packaged builtin skills automatically; `/game new`
is optional unless you want the starter world + play-agent scaffold
immediately.

> **First run walks you through API setup.** Pick **Claude Code (MCP)** if
> you already have it, paste a key for **Anthropic / OpenAI / DeepSeek /
> OpenRouter / [GLM free tier](https://zhipuai.cn)**, or point to a local
> server via **Ollama / LM Studio**. Keys save to `~/.neonrp/config.json`;
> change later via `[3] settings / api`.
> [Full provider guide →](https://docs.worldlines.gg/docs/getting-started/quickstart)

Type `look around` and press Enter. That is your first agentic turn.
